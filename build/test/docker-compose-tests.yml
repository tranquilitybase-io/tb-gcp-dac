# It enables testing against a GCP environment if the file credentials.json and ec-config.yaml have been created and exist in the project root directory
# See documentation [here](https://github.com/tranquilitybase-io/tb-gcp-dac/wiki/RunServicesWithDocker)
# Make a copy called docker-compose-local.yml for testing locally
